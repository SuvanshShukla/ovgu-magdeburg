# Database Concepts Exercise 8

## Question 1

Given relational schema R(ABCDE) with following functional dependencies:

AB-> CDE, B -> C, C -> D, E -> A

Determine all keys and generate the BCNF step by step.

Left: B 
Middle: A, E, C 
Right: D 

Elements on the Left must always be a part of the key (as they are not derived/determined by any other element)
Elements in the middle can be used for trying out various combinations
Elements on the right will never be a part of the key (as they are only derived and do not derive other elements themselves)

Testing different combinations:

1. B -> C,D 
2. BA -> C,D,E (this key can derive all the elements)
3. BE -> A,C,D (this key can derive all the elements)
4. BC -> D 
5. EC -> D,A 

Therefore, the only valid keys are: BA & BE
Notice how B is in both keys.

Normalizing all the way to BCNF:

1st Normal Form: AB -> C,D,E 
2nd Normal Form: AB -> DE | B -> C 
3rd Normal Form: AB -> D | B -> C | AB -> E 
BCNF Normal Form: AB -> D | B -> C | E -> A 

## Question 2

Given the following two sets of functional dependencies:

• A ->  B, A ->  C, CD ->  E, B ->  D
• A ->  BC, AD ->  E, DB ->  B, A ->  D

Test systematicall, if both sets are equivalent, one set is a superset of the other,
or none of the sets is semantically contained in the other!

Let,
X = {A ->  B, A ->  C, CD ->  E, B ->  D}
Y = {A ->  BC, AD ->  E, DB ->  B, A ->  D} 

Considering Y, 
Taking the FD: A -> B,C we decompose it into A -> B & A -> C. Both of these FDs are present in X.   
Considering the FD: AD -> E, from the previous decomposition we know that A -> C, so we can derive CD -> E which is also present in X.      
Considering the FD: A -> D, from the first decomposition we found that A -> B, so we can derive B -> D, which is also present in X.         
Finally, Considering the FD: DB -> B. No FD in X can determine DB -> B. Hence, X ⊂ Y.       

## Question 3

Given the following functional dependencies over relation R(A,B,C,D):

A ->  C, B ->  CD

Which of the following decompositions is lossless and/or dependency preserving?

• R1(A, B), R2(A, C, D)
• R1(A, C), R2(B, C, D)
• R1(A, B), R2(B, C, D)
• R1(A, B, C), R2(B, C, D)

R1(A, B), R2(A, C, D) -- is not lossless    
R1(A, C), R2(B, C, D) -- is lossless & dependency preserving    
R1(A, B), R2(B, C, D) -- is not lossless    
R1(A, B, C), R2(B, C, D) -- is lossless & dependency preserving     

## Question 4

A database designer decomposed relation R(ABCDE) into relations R1(ABC) and R2(CDE). State at least two functional dependencies in R so that the
decomposition into R1 \& R2 is:

(a) neither lossless nor dependency preserving
(b) lossless but not dependency preserving
(c) not lossless but dependency preserving
(d) lossless as well as dependency preserving

For an FD/relation to be lossless, the following conditions must be met:

- no information must be lost during decomposition
- the natural join of the relations should return the original relation 

For an FD/relation to be dependency preserving, the FDs of the original schema must still hold true for the decomposed schema

So,

(a) The FDs: `ABC -> D & C -> E` would make the decomposition neither lossless nor dependency preserving
(b) The FDs: `AB -> C & AC -> DE` would make the decomposition lossless but not dependency preserving
(c) The FDs: `ABC -> C & C -> DE` would make the decomposition dependency preserving but not lossless
(d) The FDs: `AB -> C & C -> DE` would make the decomposition lossless as well as dependency preserving

## Question 5

Given following relation:

| STUDENT | COURSE | INSTRUCTOR |
| ------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Mueller | C1     | Heinz      |
| Meier   | C1     | Heinz      |
| Meier   | C2     | Paul       |
| Schmidt | C1     | Peter      |

Decompose the data according to the three given possibilities and join them
together afterwards.

(a) Teach1(STUDENT, INSTRUCTOR) Teach2(STUDENT,COURSE) 
(b) Teach1(COURSE, INSTRUCTOR) Teach2(COURSE, STUDENT) 
(c) Teach1(INSTRUCTOR, COURSE) Teach2(INSTRUCTOR, STUDENT)
