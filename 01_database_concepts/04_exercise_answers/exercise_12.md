## Question 1

Prepare an entity-relationship schema to store information about insurance contracts:
A customer concludes policies with an insurance company. In the database,
all information about policies should be stored. Every policy has an identifying contract number,
an insurance number, a start and an end date. In addition,
every policy has at least one assignee (beneficiary). Every assignee insured with
a defined portion of the amount. Moreover, the payment date should be stored
if the insurance case occurs. Every assignee is a person. Additionally, the bank
account of the assignee must be stored. Moreover, the insurance subject, the
due date for dues and a status must be stored. A customer is a person that
has an address (first and last name, postal code, city) and contact information
(phone and email). In addition to the personal information, every customer
has a customer number. Some customers do not have a policy yet, but every
policy belongs to exactly one customer.
