## 1. Your task is to design a database about software products. Every software pro-
## duct has a name, a version number, a price and is created by a software company.

## ly, some software products require other software products to run (e.g., Oracle8i
## requires Java). Thereby, a software product can be required by more than one
## other software product or not at all.
