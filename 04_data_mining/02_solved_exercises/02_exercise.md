# Exercise 2

## 1. A patient goes to see a doctor. Suppose the doctor performs a test with 90% reliability, i.e., 99% of people who are sick test positive and 99% of the healthy people test negative. The doctor knows that only 1% of the people in the country are sick. If a patient has tested positive, what is the probability he is sick?
