# Naive Bayes

## What is Naive Bayes

In certain scenarios it is hard to determine how to classify a record. This includes cases where the record's attributes is identical to the test records.  
This is where we use a probablistic approach for classification and hence this is where Bayes theorem comes in to play.     

According to the book **Bayes Theorem** is:

> a statistical principle for combining prior knowledge of the classes with new evidence gathered from data.
