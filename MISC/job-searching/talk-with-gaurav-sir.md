# Job Search Advice From Gaurav

## Questions to ask:

- What should be my approach ?
- Where should I go to look for jobs specifically in Magdeburg ?
- What differences would there be for searching for technical jobs ? 
- Should I simply try for easy jobs like in McDonalds, waiter or other such kind of job ?

What my plan is: To get any job right now first, then focus on technical jobs.

If I want in my own field I'll have to do by myself.
Working student. 
Flier, waiter or warehouse -> get references for these 

I'll have to give around 100 to 150 appplications 
See on Indeed, Monster
Openings are posted but you'll need to see if they're 

Find companies, and keep following them. 

Sir will help me write a good cover letter, and fixup my resume. 

Just for financial support I should focus on after my exams.
I should apply and and keep and eye.

You have to keep applying, don't stop and wait to hear baack
Apply in such a way that 

If you hear back then we search someone who works there, then we will try to connect with him. 
This is to get a refferal, if yes -> good, if no still go ahead. 

I can get assistance/refferal/sites for part time like warehouse, McD etc...
But I should keep trying to apply for student jobs. 
There are openings but I need to keep applying.

It'll take 1 to 2 months just to get the hang of it. 
Sometimes they won't offer you a job because you are outside of Magdeburg.
But I should still apply there. WFH can be negotiated. But getting there is more important.
Usually people get student jobs only in the second year. 

check out -> Stepstone, Monster, linkedin and indeed 
A lot of these websites have an alert feature to get notifications whenever jobs matching your profile are posted.
The moment you get an alert just apply.

Read the job description, then rework your CV, resume and cover letter and maybe email.
Look for jobs that are only a few days old. DOn't apply to jobs that are a few monthds old.
Look at the job description, the company's website to find out how old the job opening is.
Find people who have worked there previously and contact them. You can look at linkedin as well.
Then find people who are in HR at the places you have applied to. Then write emails with a few lines about yourself and what you did + what kind of job you are looking for

Get the shortlist and call first. 

Keywords to search: "Student Jobs", "digital engineering", "what I'm studying in digital engineering"

What to do if you hear a positive response from a place you have applied.

Having web-development is a good plus.
You can search for web dev jobs straight away. In your cover letter or application you can mention you are looking for job.
After they approve it then you can tell them that you are on student job and are looking for part time.
Web dev is good and I should get a lot of opporunity 

Web dev translate into german and search. 
Hightlight this on your linkedin profile and search. 

Many people don't prioritze if you are part time or full time, web dev work is work. WFH is okay with a lot of companies/employers.
Development field may not really require German that much.

Having german proficiency certificates will allow you to apply to far more places.
Telc and goethe are also here. You can give exams from there.
Goethe is slightly easier here (according to Gaurav).
In Goethe, you need to pass each hearing, reading, writing and speaking individually.
Telc allows you to retry any failed section in a few days too.

People who get student jobs have a far higher likely hood of getting placed when their Masters is completed.

- use good fonts in the cv 
- use fewer colors as HR will most likely print them out when they ask you to come for interview
