## Why do so many courses in OVGU make you do weekly assignment exercises?

It turns out that the reason is because if you are able to fulfill their criteria (like finish 80% of exercises yourself and even present your solution a couple of times) then there's a good chance you'll pass the final exam for that course. This is why there's only one exam for the course at the end of the semester.
