## Exercise 8 - 2-3-4 Trees

### 1

A 2-3-4 Tree is a tree data structure where each node may have up to 2 or 3 or 4 data items in node of the tree.  
The 2-3-4 tree is self-balancing tree under the broader categorization of B-trees.
Each child node of a 2-3-4 Tree may have 2 to 4 children. Another property of 2-3-4 trees is that all of their nodes
are always at the same level helping to ensure balance.
