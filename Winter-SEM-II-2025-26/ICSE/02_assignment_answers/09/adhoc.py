# We already have a BinaryTree class and now we have to implement
# is_balanced(self) -> bool this checks whether the given
# (sub)tree is AVL balanced or not and returns the corresponding bool value
# and inorder_next(self) -> BinaryTree | None this returns the node that would
# come next inorder traversal We can assume that the BinaryTree is also
# a SearchTree If no such successor exists then return None
