## Basic Terms Solution

`Algorithm`: An algorithm is a set of predefined steps used to complete a task.  

`Termination`: This is a state or condition that must be fulfilled to stop an ongoing algorithm.

`Deterministic Process`: A process that gives the same output every time for the same given input is a deterministic process.

`Deterministic Result`: A result that can be reproduced every time the same inputs are give is a deterministic result.

### 1. What is the algorithm here?

In the context of the candies, the algorithm is the set of predefined steps that we follow to eat and replace the candies in the bowl.

### 2. Does the process terminate?

Yes, the process terminates when the bowl runs out of blue candies.

### 3. How many candies will remain in the glass?

No candies will remain in the glass.

### 4. Is the process deterministic?

Yes, the process is deterministic.

### 5. Is the result deterministic?

Yes, the result is deterministic.
