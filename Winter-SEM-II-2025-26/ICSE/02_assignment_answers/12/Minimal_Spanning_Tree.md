A minimal spanning tree only contains those edges of its original graph that are needed to keep the graph connected, but not a single edge more.

We need to compute a minimum spanning tree and give the sum of all the weights of all edges contained in the MST.

The edges of the minimum spanning tree are:

```text

b--a--h--g--f--c--i
               |
               d--e
```

With the sum of weights being: 4 + 8 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 7 + 9 = 37
