## Prime Numbers

A number $n \epsilon N, n > 1$ is called prime if it has exactly two factors: 1 and itself.

1. Write a function `is_prime(n: int) -> bool` that takes an integer `n` and returns True if and only if `n` is prime.

2. Write a function `next_prime(n: int) -> int` that returns the next prime number p that is larger than or equal to n, i.e. if n is prime, return n, otherwise return the next larger prime number.

3. Within the main function give suitable test cases for your functions.

**Hint:**
    - This assignment is tested automatically. For the tests to work you must not change the signature of the functions nor the modifiers!
