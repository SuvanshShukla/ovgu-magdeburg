## Assignment 5 Task 5.3

### (a)

A classification tree predicts nominal values. But, a regression tree predicts numbered values.  
Classification deals with discrete outcomes, like Yes/No or any category. But, regression trees  
deal with continuous values, like temperature, price etc...  

They also have different evaluation metrics. Classification trees use Precision, Recall and F1-Score.  
While Regression trees use Mean Squared Error, R2-Score, MAPE and RMSE.  

Decision boundaries in classification trees are clearly defined while regression trees don't have  
distinct boundaries.  

### (b)

In regression our primary goal is to find the best fit line that can represent the relationship between  
independent variables (inputs) and a dependent variable (output). This best fit line may be linear or  
non-linear. 

A way to judge whether our best fit line is adequate and accurate is to use an error function that can  
find difference between our predicted values and the real values. One such function is the Sum of Squared  
Errors or SSE. Using this function to minimize the error when predicting values helps us increase the  
accuracy and performance our classifier.  

SSE can be used to compare what splits on a node would perform better and give better accuracy.
