### Part A

Though KNN uses may use majority vote for labeling, there may be scenarios where the majority class may be misleading. One such scenario is when there is class imbalance in the dataset, leading to one class to be more numerous than others. This means that when trying to label the data point in question, even though it may be surrounded by instances from the more numerous class, it may actually belong to one of the less numerous (minority) classes. This would ultimately cause the instance to be mislabelled.
