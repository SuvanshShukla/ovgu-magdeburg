## Assignment 9 Task 1

### Part A

One of the reasons why such algorithms like Naive Bayes might fail is because it assumes that there is no correlation between any of the instances in the dataset. We know this to not be true in real life, especially in the case of time-series where one instance is dependent on its predecessor.

Another case where a non-sequential data classification algorithm like K Nearest Neighbors may fail is that the proximity or similarity of data may not have any actual relevance. This would be especially obvious when trying to use KNN for text prediction, just because two words are closer to each other in proximity doesn't mean that one will always come after another.
