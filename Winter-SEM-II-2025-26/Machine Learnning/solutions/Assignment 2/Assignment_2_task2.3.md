## Assignment 2 Task 2.3

**For Categorical features**: I would suggest using a Naive Bayes classifier. This should work as Naive Bayes uses a supervised learning approach requiring labelled data. Using the 0-1 loss function we could also try to approximate it's accuracy.

**For Numerical features**: we could use Gaussian distribution model. This would allow us to use certain parameters of the dataset like mean $\mu$ or variance $\sigma$. Thanks to the ubiquity of such a model, inference and estimation would be simplified as well.
