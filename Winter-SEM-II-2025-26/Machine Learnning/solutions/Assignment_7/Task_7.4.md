### Softmax function

A **Softmax** activation function that converts the raw output scores into a vector of probabilities
that sum to 1. The class with the highest probability is the network's prediction.

Softmax function formula:

$$
\hat{y}_k = \frac{e^{z_k}}{\sum_{j=1}^{C}e^{z_j}}
$$

Where $C$ is the number of classes.
