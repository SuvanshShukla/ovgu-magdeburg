# Exercise 1 - SCRUM

Written By: Suvansh Shukla (matriculation number: 256245)

## Task I - Agile Software Development

### 1. Give an example of at least three values or principles of agile software development.

The following are three examples of values of agile software development: 

1. focus on individuals and interaction
2. focus on working software
3. focus on customer collaboration

### What could be the reasons for the success of agile methods in the last 20 years?

I believe that the primary reason for the success of agile methods must be its adaptability. Agile provides developers and their managers a greater degree of flexibility. This flexibility in turn allows the team to quickly change their work flow to focus on sudden changes in priority. If software development always required the team to follow a rigid protocol of going through every stage one-by-one, then updates and fixes would take too long or would simply never be addressed. 

The second feature of that makes agile so successful is its emphasis on collaboration. Under agile a team can adjust their pace of working by having regular meetings and calls to discuss issues and blockers. This fosters clear communication and team work resulting in a improved work environment.

## Task II - Scrum

### Describe the Scrum process model! Explain the different central meetings/rituals and the terms Product Backlog, Sprint, Sprint Backlog and User Story.

The SCRUM process model is a model that focuses on flexibility and promotes teamwork. One of the central facets of the SCRUM model is that all work is split into time periods called "sprints". These time periods usually range from one to two weeks and the goal is for the team to finish all the tasks that they choose in the period of a sprint. SCRUM also has other features like "the daily stand-up" which is usual a meeting (online or offline, though increasingly online) attended by the entire team. The daily stand-up is used to discuss the progress made, the tasks that are to be worked on today as well as any issues, blockers or other topics that may require input from the rest of the team members. 

SCRUM also uses other terms, like "Product Backlog". Product Backlog is basically a list of tasks that are new and haven't been picked up by any member of the team for active development. Tasks that the team has decided to work on for a given sprint are placed under the "Sprint Backlog".

User Stories are ways of labeling similar tasks or work items that have a larger common purpose. For example a user story for a login functionality may include smaller tickets for tasks related to API creation, API integration and user interface design.
