## Task I - Agile Software Development

### 1. Give an example of at least three values or principles of agile software development.

The following are three examples of values of agile software development: 

1. focus on individuals and interaction
2. focus on working software
3. focus on customer collaboration

### What could be the reasons for the success of agile methods in the last 20 years?

I believe that the primary reason for the success of agile methods must be its adaptability. Agile provides developers and their managers a greater degree of flexibility. This flexibility in turn allows the team to quickly change their work flow to focus on sudden changes in priority. If software development always required the team to follow a rigid protocol of going through every stage one-by-one, then updates and fixes would take too long or would simply never be addressed. 

The second feature of that makes agile so successful is its emphasis on collaboration. Under agile a team can adjust their pace of working by having regular meetings and calls to discuss issues and blockers. This fosters clear communication and team work resulting in a improved work environment.
