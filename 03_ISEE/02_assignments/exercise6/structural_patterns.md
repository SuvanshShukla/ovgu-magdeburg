Learning objective

Structural patterns can be used as a template for various problems, just like behavioral patterns. Some were presented in the lecture. Here you should deal with them again.

## Task

You are part of a development studio that is currently developing a Real Time Strategy game.

At the beginning of a match, the player always starts with the basic versions of his faction’s troops. However, these can be improved over the course of the round and gain new abilities. They deal specifically with the Swordsman troop. Like any other version, the basic version of the Swordsman has the variables health_points and damage_per_second as well as the methods moveToPosition and attack. You can see a class diagram of the implemented basic version of the Swordsman below.

You should now extend the implementation of the Swordsman so that the troops can be improved in the course of the game. You have to make sure that it is easy for other developers to add further improvements for troops in future updates.

- Which design pattern presented in the lecture offers a good solution to the problem described?
- Expand the UML diagram with the notation presented in the lecture!
- Think about 2 possible capabilities that can be added to the ‘Wordsman’ force.
- Do not use multiple inheritance!
