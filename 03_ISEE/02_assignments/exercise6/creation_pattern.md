Creational patterns serve as a template for creating objects. Here you should deal with it again.

## Task

In the development of an online card game, we are working on a tool for creating cards, as cards are currently coded manually, which results in a lot of duplicated code. The card generation should be easily expandable and exchangeable. You should first implement monster and spell cards using a sensible structure. Both card types have both an artwork and an effect, but these must be implemented differently for each object.

Which design pattern presented in the lecture offers a good solution to the problem described? Draw a UML diagram using the notation presented in the lecture.
