Learning objective

Behavioral patterns can be used as a template for various problems. Some were presented in the lecture. Here you should deal with them again.

## Task

In the figure below you can see a rudimentary class diagram for a combination of a calendar and an alarm clock app.

The calendar app should enable a suitable alarm clock to be set automatically for an Appointment. Calendar is responsible for creating objects of Appointment and deleting them if necessary. AlarmClock is responsible for setting the associated alarm clocks.

Apply a design pattern known from the lecture to the given classes which allows AlarmClock to be informed about changes to the Calendar. Add further classes according to the chosen design pattern and complete the class diagram with all the necessary components! In addition, use the UML notation familiar from the lecture for design pattern for labeling the components.
