# ISEE Exercise - Exam Task

Written By: Suvansh Shukla (matriculation number: 256245)

## Examination task

Here you have the opportunity to actively help shape your exam. Think of one (or more) tasks that you could use to check whether a student has understood a certain subject area (or part of it) as part of a written exam.

These could be simple definition questions or more complex case studies, for example.

Your submission should include at least the following points:

1. Task text This is the description that explains the task.
2. Points How many points should the task be worth? Assume that that 1 point is awarded for every two minutes. The exam lasts 120 minutes and will give a total of 60 points.
3. Sample solution What do you think should give points, what should not give points? points? How many points should be awarded for which parts of a solution?

In the lecture on 03.07.2024 we will discuss all submissions for this task. The tasks that are in principle suitable for a written exam will all be published (including the solution). We will use at least one of all published tasks (possibly in a slightly modified form) for the real exam.

### My Suggested Exam Tasks 

#### 1. Possible problems in requirement analysis

Task text/Description:

> You are a new hire in a small paper selling company by the name of Dundster Mufflins (with fewer than 50 people) 
> and you've been tasked with making a new app that improves the productivity of the company.
> You've decided to go around the office and ask your fellow co-workers what features they would like to have in the app.
> Your task is to write down at least 4 possible problems/issues you may face when trying to collect all the requirements from your co-workers.
> Also mention if such a way of gathering requirements is a good or bad idea, and write briefly on why or why not.

Points for this task: 2  
Explanation for marking scheme: 1 point for the listed issues, 1 point on why/why not this method was good  

Example solution:

> Here are the four possible issues that may arise when trying to get all the relevant requirements for the app:
> 1. No common vision for the app 
> 2. Contradictory requirements
> 3. Unclear communication or use of jargon that is not understood by everyone
> 4. Asking for everyone's opinion may make it hard to prioritize what requirements are actually important
> 
> This is not a good way of gathering requirements as the overall purpose of the app hasn't been established,
> this make it unclear what purpose the app servers and what it could really be used for. Also asking everyone in the office 
> can lead to too many stakeholders and unduly influence the formation or priority of the requirements.

#### 2. Does the pattern fit?

Task Text/Description:

> You are working on a new product for a bank and have been given the following set of requirements: (requirement A, requirement B, requirement C, etc...)
> Using these requirements determine what structural, behavioral, or creation pattern would you choose when writing the code implementation.

Points for this task: 6     
Explanation for marking scheme: 1 point for each structural, behavioral and or creation pattern mentioned and 1 point on why it was chosen      
Patterns that are unfeasible, overkill or simply not needed would not receive a point.
