Written By: Suvansh Shukla (matriculation number: 256245)

## Examination task

Here you have the opportunity to actively help shape your exam. Think of one (or more) tasks that you could use to check whether a student has understood a certain subject area (or part of it) as part of a written exam.

These could be simple definition questions or more complex case studies, for example.

Your submission should include at least the following points:

1. Task text This is the description that explains the task.
2. Points How many points should the task be worth? Assume that that 1 point is awarded for every two minutes. The exam lasts 120 minutes and will give a total of 60 points.
3. Sample solution What do you think should give points, what should not give points? points? How many points should be awarded for which parts of a solution?

In the lecture on 03.07.2024 we will discuss all submissions for this task. The tasks that are in principle suitable for a written exam will all be published (including the solution). We will use at least one of all published tasks (possibly in a slightly modified form) for the real exam.
