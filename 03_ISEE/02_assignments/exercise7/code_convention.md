# Exercise 7 

## Task 1 - Coding Conventions 

### Question 1 - What are coding conventions?

Coding conventions are rules/principles that are put in place to allow standardzation of coding sytle and structure throughout the project.

### Quesiton 2 - Why does it make sense to agree on common coding conventions within a team?

It makes sense to agree on common coding conventions within a team because of the following reasons:

- convenience
- clarity
- uniformity
- speed

## Task 2 - Task 2 - Examples

### Research two other coding guidelines that were not covered in the lecture! Explain them using an example! You can choose any programming language and a style guide of your choice.

Coding guideline 1 - Low Coupling

It is a good idea to have low coupling between different modules as it helps keep code more maintainable and editable.      
This also helps reduce data dependency between two processes or features that are supposed to be independent.

Coding guideline 2 - High Modularity

It is a good idea to have high modularity between different modules as it helps keep code easier to read and understand.    
A higher degree of modularity enables the reuse of code and reduces the chances of failure in one module affecting another.
