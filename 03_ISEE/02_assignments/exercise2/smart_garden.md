## Task 2.2 - Smart Garden

Written By: Suvansh Shukla (matriculation number: 256245)

### The following are the 5 functional requirements of the Smart Home project

1. Segregation of area:

Different areas in the garden bed should be separated appropriately for the different kinds of plants that will be grown.       
There should be enough area to include vegetables, fruits and flowers.  

2. Monitor Solar Radiation:  

There should be a cap on the amount of solar radiation hitting the soil of the garden bed.      
Regulation of the solar radiation would be required to adapt the sunshade to cover or uncover the garden bed.   

3. Soil water content management:

Water level of the soil must be maintained at an optimum level.     
There needs to be an alert if the level of water is too low in a certain area of the garden bed.

4. WLAN connectivity: 

WLAN connectivity must be present so that we can receive all the relevant alerts related to water level and solar radiation.    
Other weather phenomena related alerts could also be included later on.     

5. Monitor plant temperature:

Temperture monitoring can be done via simple thermometer attached to the side of the garden bed.    
It would then be hooked upto some sensor which would electronically send alerts to us over WLAN.    
These alerts could be via email, SMS, etc. and would inform us about sudden changes in temperature or extremes in temperature during the summer and winter seasons.     

### The following are the 3 non-functional requirements of the Smart Home project

1. The table height should be good for the back

A specific table height should be decided. Perhaps somewhere around 70cm, which would be just right.    
This would allow us to cover as much of the garden as possible without bending down too much or having us to stand on the tips of our toes.

2. Sunshade should be automatic

The sunshade's movement of covering and uncovering should be automatic and can be motor or servo controlled.    
This would allow the best amount of sunlight for plant growth throughout the entire day.    
This would also reduce human effort in having to manually furl or unfurl the sunshade.  

3. Data transmission format

The data tranmission format can be chosen so that it brings us the most convenience and fastest alerts.     
A preferable method of transmission would be simple email alerts over the internet.     
This would be relateively secure and easy to implement in most programming languages.   
Email could also be extended later on to support other hyper-text media types like images or videos in the future.
