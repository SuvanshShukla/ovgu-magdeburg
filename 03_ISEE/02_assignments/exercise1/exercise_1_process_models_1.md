## Task I - Process Models

### 1. Why is it useful to use a process model during development?

It is useful to use a process model during development because of the following reasons:
1. It establishes a pattern that the entire team can follow
2. It organizes the flow of work so that all the team members can cooperate fully
3. Having a process model allows the project manager to have a better understanding of the progress and completeness of the project

### 2. which stages of the software life cycle are found in all process models? process models?

The stages of **analysis**, **implementation** and **testing** are found in all process models. This is because each model requires analyzing requirements, working on implementations to address those requirements. Then finally, testing to see if the implemented features work properly and are bug free.

### 3. 5 different process models were presented in the lecture. Which ones are they?

The five different process models which were presented in the lecture were:
1. Waterfall model
2. V model
3. Spiral model
4. SCRUM
5. Kanban

## Task II - Sequential & Iterative Models

### 1. What do sequential and iterative mean in this context?

In this context, `sequential` means that all the stages occur one after another. That is, they cannot be skipped or retraced. An example of a `sequential` process model is the waterfall model. In the waterfall model once the Design stage has been crossed, we must move to the implementation stage even if issues are discovered during development.

In contrast `iterative` means that the stages can be revisted for rework, improvement or change. An example of an `iterative` process model would be the spiral model, where we can go to the design stage again and introduce changes before implementing new features.

### 2. Name a sequential process model and its advantages and disadvantages!

A sequential process model would be the **waterfall model**.

It's advantages include:

1. Easy to follow: even developers with very minimal experience can follow such a process model.
2. Easy to manage: managers of any capability would find a waterfall process model easy to manage as each stage is distinct and cannot be walked back.

It's disadvantages are:

1. Hard to fix mistakes that happened in previous stages
2. Not a good fit for scenarios with dynamically changing requirements

### 3. Briefly explain the spiral model! What is the iterative behaviour in this model?

The spiral model is an iterative process model of software development. In this model stages of software development are recurring. This means that features are added to the product one-by-one where the product slowly matures and gains all the features and udergoes changes again and again by going through all the relevant stages multiple times. This continuous addition of features and changes leads to a working product after each stage and the continue cycle of update is what refers to its "iterative" behaviour.
