## Task I - eLearning tool for AI engineering


## Task II - Wildlife camera

The process model that would be most suitable for this scenario would be the "Sprial Model". There are multiple reasos for this decision. Since a working version of the platform must be available at all times, the sprial model would enable the development of a working prototype right after the completion of the first iteration. Since multiple people from different universities may be involved in the project the sprial model would also be a better fit for organisig all the team members. Also since the time and cost aren't a big factor constant iteration and change can be easily incorporated in the development process under this model. This model would also be uniquely suited to develop different variants and be tested over the course of the project.

## Task II - Wildlife camera

The process model that would be the most suitable for such a project would be the waterfall model. Since only a single person would be working on the project there would be no need for extensive and complicated organization. Since the design of the camera is already done and the requirements of usage are also specified and not subject to change a waterfall model's focus on separate stages would enable streamlined work and there would be no fear of re-work or having to trace the previous stages. The camera being primarily for wildlife photography would be placed in a very remote location so new feature deployments would be rare if any at all. This would meant that the step-by-step sequence of work would likely not be interrupted. Finally since the camera and software would need to work continuously for the next six months, maintenance of the developed software would also play an imporant role, this is something that the waterfall model would be extremely suitable for.
