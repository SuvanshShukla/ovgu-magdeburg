## Task I - eLearning tool for AI engineering


## Task II - Wildlife camera

The process model that would be most suitable for this scenario would be the "Sprial Model". There are multiple reasos for this decision. Since a working version of the platform must be available at all times, the sprial model would enable the development of a working prototype right after the completion of the first iteration. Since multiple people from different universities may be involved in the project the sprial model would also be a better fit for organisig all the team members. Also since the time and cost aren't a big factor constant iteration and change can be easily incorporated in the development process under this model. This model would also be uniquely suited to develop different variants and be tested over the course of the project.
