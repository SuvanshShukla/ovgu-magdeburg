# ISEE Exercise 8 - Testig Basics

## Learning Objective

In the lecture, the basics and 4 possible test phases in the V-model were discussed. These are repeated here using a practical example.

## Task - Test phases

You are responsible for a large software project in which an intelligent signalling and point setting system for long-distance rail transport is being developed. The system comprises several levels from a graphical user interface to drivers for controlling the mechanical elements.

This project is based on the V-model and the implementation is largely complete. Testing of the software should now begin.

- Name the four test phases presented in the lecture and briefly explain the purpose of each phase.
- different strategies can be used in the second test phase. Which of these strategies is best suited to the software project? Briefly explain the strategy you have chosen and explain why other strategies are unsuitable.

### Four Test Phases 

1. **Unit Test**: used to determine the error state clearly. Each component is tested individually 
2. **Integration Test**: used to find errors in the interfaces and interactions between the components. components are integrated into subsystems. This is performed by developers, testers, Integration teams.
3. **System Test**: Used to determine if the system meets the requirements. This testing is done from the user's perspective, as most functions can only be used in a fully integrated system.
4. **Acceptance Test**: This is testing is done to create trust in the product rather than finding errors. This includes the customer's view and opinion. This is the only testing phase that directly involves the customer and is carried out at the customer's premises in the new system environment.
