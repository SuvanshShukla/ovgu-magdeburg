## Learning objective

State diagrams describe the behavior and permissible use of a system. In this task, you will use written descriptions to create a state diagrama and practise their syntax.

## Traffic light system

Create a state diagram for the following scenario!

For traffic light control, induction loops are used in some places to report whether a car is currently at a red light. If it has been at the junction for at least 2 minutes, the traffic light is switched to red-orange. After 3 seconds, the light turns green. As long as cars drive over the stop line, the release is extended until the sensor detects a gap in the traffic flow. The traffic light then changes from green to orange. Alternatively, the traffic light is also switched to orange if the traffic light has been green for at least 2 minutes. After 3 seconds, the traffic light switches back to red.
