## Differences between Network diagram and Gantt chart

The primary difference between a network diagram and a Gantt chart is that, the Gantt chart integrates dates better than the network diagram.   
The Gantt chart also has the unfortunate side-effect of not being able to display the dependencies properly.    
The Gantt chart is also represented by bars on a calendar, while the network diagram uses blocks to denote processes.   
The Gantt chart more intuitively displays the duration of each process, while in the network diagram the duration is just written in the blocks.
