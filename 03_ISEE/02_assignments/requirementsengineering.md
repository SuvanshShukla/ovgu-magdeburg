# Task 2.1 - Requirements Engineering

## Task 1 - Requirements

### 1. What is a requirements analysis?

Requirement analysis refers to the process of defining user expectations of a new software or software that needs to be modified.

### 2. Why is it an important part of your first (software) project?

It is an important part of the first software project because of the following reasons:     

1. It reduces re-work and technical debt
2. It enables developers to tackle features that the user actually wants and not what the developer thinks they want
3. It is vital for scheduling, organizing and keeps scope creep in check
4. It allows developers to make better decision like what technology to use (e.g. tech-stack or DB model etc.)

### 3. What problems could arise during the requirements analysis and how can you avoid them? (Name 3 problems!)




### 4. What is the difference between requirements analysis and requirements engineering?


### 5. What are functional and non-functional requirements? Give 3 examples each that were not mentioned in the lecture!


### 6. What are stakeholders and how can you differentiate them from customers and users?
