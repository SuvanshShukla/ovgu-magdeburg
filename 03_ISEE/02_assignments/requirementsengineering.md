# Task 2.1 - Requirements Engineering

## Task 1 - Requirements

### 1. What is a requirements analysis?

Requirement analysis refers to the process of defining user expectations of a new software or software that needs to be modified.

### 2. Why is it an important part of your first (software) project?

It is an important part of the first software project because of the following reasons:     

1. It reduces re-work and technical debt
2. It enables developers to tackle features that the user actually wants and not what the developer thinks they want
3. It is vital for scheduling, organizing and keeps scope creep in check
4. It allows developers to make better decision like what technology to use (e.g. tech-stack or DB model etc.)

### 3. What problems could arise during the requirements analysis and how can you avoid them? (Name 3 problems!)

There can be slew of different problems that could arise during requirement analysis. The following are some of the problems and how to avoid them:

1. Constantly changing requirements: Sometimes due to the nature of business or work the requirements that need to be addressed can be dynamic and change constantly. A good way to avoid this is to fix some requirements that would form the basis of your application and then slowly take up changes iteratively
2. Miscommunication among developers and clients: This is more of a simple side-effect of human-to-human interaction. Ways to avoid this problem would include having the developers and clients speak the same language, having a "domain knowledge expert" on the developer side who may understand client & developer jargon. 
3. Unsupportive stakeholders: This problem may arise when the stakeholders aren't too knowledgeable about the requirements or have different goals than the developer team. One way to tackle such a problem involves having clear goals and alignment before the project begins so everyone is clear on the what the other expects out of the project.

### 4. What is the difference between requirements analysis and requirements engineering?

Though both terms deal with requirements, they do have some differences. Requirements engineering is a superset of requirements analysis. Requirements engineering happens throughout the entire lifecycle of application developement, while requirement analysis usually takes places during the initial stages of the developement lifecycle.

### 5. What are functional and non-functional requirements? Give 3 examples each that were not mentioned in the lecture!

Functional requirements are requirements that the client or end-user has explicitly demanded and are vital for application/project delivery. Meanwhile non-functional requirements are requirements that specify how the functional requirements should perform and how they would achieve their intended purpose.

Examples of functional requirements for a fantasy RPG video game:

- the user should be able to move around
- the user should be able to equip weapons
- the user should be able to cast spells

Examples of non-functional requirements for the same game:

- the game world should load quickly
- the game should not be buggy
- the game should not crash with multiple enemies being active at the same time

### 6. What are stakeholders and how can you differentiate them from customers and users?

Stakeholders are members of the team that have some stake in the completion of the project even though they may not directly be involved int the development lifecycle.

They are different from customers and users as they are not the intended audience or target group for whom the application is being developed. 

## Task 2 - Requirements analysis

In the lecture, 4 phases of requirements analysis were mentioned.

### 2.a What are they?

The four phases of requirements analysis are:

1. Identify key stakeholders
2. Define project goals
3. Get requirements from stakeholders
4. Categorize requirements

### 2.b What is done in each of the phases?

**Identifying stakeholders**: this phase involves meeting with all the relevant persons that may be involved with the development or deployment of the project.

**Define project goals**: This phase involves setting all the relevant goals that need to be achieved for complete and timely delivery of the project.

**Get requirements from stakeholders**: This phase involves defining the requirements that would be actively worked on during the development lifecycle.

**Categorize requirements**: This phase involves organizing and grouping similar requirements for better organized workflow for iterative development.
