# HCAI Project topic research

started this on 24/04/2025

## Possible topics of the project

- How non-technical people write prompts
- Main challenges faced by non-techincal people when writing prompts
- Why are some prompts more effective than others

## Chosen Domain - Evaluation of potential threats for users in HCAI systems

Big idea question: "What are some possible ways AI could be abused or exploited by bad actors"

Possible sub-topics for discussion:

- prompt injection
- contextual manipulation
- jailbreaking

### Prompt injection as a threat vector in LLM supplimented applications

- possible consequences of prompt injection #human-aspect
    - how humans may be affected (direct & in-direct) #human-aspect
    - other widespread affects (misinformation, economic loss, etc.) #human-aspect
- hiding prompts in places humans can't read #HCAI-aspect #realiability
    - like in hidden text
    - like in images
    - like in encoded data
    - like in program code
- possible ways to catch prompt injection #HCAI-aspect #trustworthiness
- possible ways to prevent prompt injection #HCAI-aspect #reliability

### Possible papers to read for the above domain

- [Prompt Injection attack against LLM-integrated Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05499)
- [Not what youâ€™ve signed up for: Compromising Real-World
LLM-Integrated Applications with Indirect Prompt Injection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12173)
- [EVALUATING THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF PRE-TRAINED LANGUAGE MODELS VIA HANDCRAFTED ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.02128)


Topic is: "Prompt injection as a threat vector in LLM supplimented applications"

Pros: it comes very nicely under the "Evaluation of potential threats for users in HCAI systems" domain
Cons: I have found 2~3 papers that are on a similar topic

## New - Topic "AI: Tool for Growth or Crutch for Cheating? Examining Dependence, Misuse, and Responsible Use in the Age of Artificial Intelligence"

## Slide contents

- three papers for review, summarize each and mention their methodology
- take down any new and useful tools
- use the HCAI templates

1. Title slide, names of both persons
2. Content (papers reviewed, tools used, useful in HCAI)
3. Introduce our topic
4. Papers referrenced and reviewed
5. Methodology/approach used to pursue our project topic
6. Any extra tools we may be using (overleaf, google surveys, latex, datasets)
7. HCAI principles involved in our topic
8. Thank you slide/ questions

## 5. Methodology/Approach

1. Literature Review of papers regarding AI dependence 
2. Survey people who use chatbots/LLMs for real world data
3. Search for case studies on AI dependence
4. Study HAI guidelines introduced by Google, Microsoft, IBM etc.
5. Review of regulations for use of AI in competency assessments (like interviews, exams, etc.)

[LINK](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389312740_Academic_self-efficacy_and_dependence_on_artificial_intelligence_in_a_sample_of_university_studentsj)

- Basically this paper says that students that are better at studies will be less dependent on AI
- helps put into prespective how the inherent capability of individuals makes them more likely to reach out to AI for assisstance.

[LINK](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/390128547_Ethical_Considerations_in_Artificial_Intelligence_and_the_Growing_Dependence_on_Data_Challenges_Implications_and_Future_Perspectives)

- This paper deals with the ethical dilema of using AI, as it must be trained on the intellectual work of others
- It tries to highlight uses of known and unknown breaches of privacy, bias, and transparency

### Teresa H., Nina P., & Oliver P. (2023) Ethical management of human-AI interaction: Theory development review. ScienceDirect.

[LINK](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963868723000185)

- This paper deals with who would get the final blame for the consequences of AI use
- It helps shed light on how difficult it is to fix accountability when a mistake or fault occurs with AI assisted work

### Fan Li & Yuan Lu (2024) Human-AI interaction and ethics of AI: how well are we following the guidelines. ACM.

[LINK](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3565698.3565773)

- This paper tries to establish and review guidelines that should be present between usage of AI by humans
- It helps highlight that unrestricted or unguided usage is not as effective nor trustworthy as following a framework
