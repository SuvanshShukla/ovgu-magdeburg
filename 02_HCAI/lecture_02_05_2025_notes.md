## Notes

- you shouldn't oversimplify emotions
- emotions are also based on culture

Robots or humanoids would overtake our way of working not supplement us. An example would be a washing machine.     
Areas where HCAI should be present is in human-to-human interaction and cooperation.

If we separate autonomy and human control, what happens when there is a conflict between both ?

Question: Would conflicts between AI autonomy and human control be possible? Would human control always override AI autonomy?

all human centered AI must be reliable, safe and trustworthy.
