# HCAI project discussion

## things to cover

- [ ] Who will cover what aspects of the project
- [ ] What our timeline should be
- [ ] What our expectations of the end result are
- [ ] How we should measure our progress
- [ ] How we should give our updates during the Friday HCAI exercises

**For updates we can say that We will try contacting therapists and otherwise we are working on 
literature review**

### Features we can look into

- detection of the cause of emotion
- save past user preferences
- voice and multi lingual support can be added (english and maybe german)
- mood tracker
- graph of emotional trends

### We also need to look into validation aspects

- blue score
- user metrics (retention metrics)
- accuracy 

We can reach out to the following groups:

- group 11 - mental health
- group 8 - sentiment analysis 
- group 22 - disease detection

- Making google form for survey [only after the application is ready]

Very rough outline of what our therapy bot implementation would look like: 

1. Find appropriate dataset
2. Get an open source LLM
3. Train the LLM on the dataset 

**HCAI Exercise Friday 16/05/2025** : We would need to have our report ready one week before the main presentation, and we would thus have one extra week to work on our implementation.
