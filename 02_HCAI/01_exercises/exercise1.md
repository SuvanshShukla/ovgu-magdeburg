## Discussions

Q: Should FE & BE should be working when we give the last/final presentation?

Ans: At least BE should be working and if it isn't for whatever reason we would need to have a video of the functionality working.

- we use a pre-fine tuned model of OLLAMA, we would need to have have a careful dataset

use "validtion matrix"
use sentiment analysis
we would need to validate our data as well
we can use pre-existing models
